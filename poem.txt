//Hello guys this poem from me -Sagar Sigdel
Underneath the moon's soft gleam,
Silent whispers in a midnight dream.
Stars above, a cosmic stream,
Nature's lullaby, a tranquil theme.

Ayo poem

In the heart of the savannah, where the sun kisses the earth,
A symphony of colors, a dance of rebirth.
Mountains stand proud, whispering tales untold,
Stories of warriors, and adventures bold.

Rivers carve paths through the vast expanse,
Reflecting the moon's enchanting dance.
Underneath the Baobab's wise embrace,
Ancestral whispers, a timeless grace.

Lions roar, a majestic melody in the night,
Stars above, shimmering with ancient light.
Drums echo through the warm, twilight air,
A celebration of life, beyond compare.

From the Sahara's dunes to the Cape of Good Hope,
A kaleidoscope of cultures, woven in hope.
Ubuntu, the spirit that binds us as one,
In the tapestry of Africa, a tale well-spun.

Feel the rhythm, let your spirit sway,
In the heart of Africa, where dreams hold sway.
A land of beauty, strength, and unity,
A symphony of life, for all eternity.
